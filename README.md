Unity Texture Combiner. Pack multiple texture color channels into one texture!

Open with **Tools/ChannelPacker**

- Combine multiple textures into one output texture (For use in Mask maps or other packed texture techniques)
- Choose which channel each texture pulls from, and where it goes to
- Invert / multiply texture inputs for desired results
- Have default 0 - 1 values for unassigned texture inputs
- Save multiple presets to have different workflows in the same project

ChannelPacker is a heavily modified / rewritten version of [MaskPacker](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/glkvp2/i_made_another_mask_map_packer_for_hdrp/).

Mask Packer was built for HDRP masks only, so I made this to be modular, flexible, and support many more workflows, while fixing some quirks / bugs I had with the original.

Thank you to the original creator of this, I appreciate it and hope others will find this to be useful :)
